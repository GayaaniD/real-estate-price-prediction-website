# Real-estate-price-prediction-website
Developed a comprehensive real estate price prediction website
- Build a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com.
- Write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests.
- Built website in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price.
- Model building covers almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc.
